Algorithmic Approach to a Personal Scheduling Assistant Project
As a Design and Analysis of Algorithms student, your objective is to create a Python- based personal scheduling assistant using efficient algorithms. The assistant will help manage and optimise daily activities by leveraging sorting and searching techniques. It will track deadlines, send reminders for upcoming or missed tasks, and offer an algorithmic solution to scheduling and prioritisation problems.
Minimum Requirements
• Use dynamic programming algorithm design techniques in all the algorithms you implement in this assignment.
• Include personal and academic tasks with appropriate labels for differentiation.
• Ensure each activity is assigned a specific time and deadlines are monitored.
• Implement efficient searching algorithms (e.g., binary search) to allow quick
retrieval of upcoming tasks.
• Use optimised sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort) to categorise
activities by priority, time, or type.
• Distinguish between personal and academic tasks for better prioritisation and
analysis.
• Analyse and represent busy time slots based on task density within specific time
intervals.
• You may implement Gantt charts to represent task schedules visually.
